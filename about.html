	The history of photography has always been moving towards making the photograph itself <b> invisible </b> and leave image as the only information. However my photography strives to renounce the photograph as an objective and perfect recreation of a scene. I am instead focused on the way that we <b>perceive</b> and <b>interact</b> with images, and how different photographic processes can interfere with and effect that interaction. I work with obsolete and damaged materials to create images which expose the <b>physicality</b> of the print and the photographic process. 

<br>
<br>
	To do this I have taken photos with an area of devoid of <b>information</b> that I placed in the scene, when printed it leaves only the traces of the <b>photographic process</b>. This breaks the illusion of the photograph being a window into a scene and exposes it as a <b>physical</b> object.
	<br>
<br>
	I photograph using <b>destroyed</b> and <b>damaged</b> film, this hinders the cameras ability to accurately  reproduce the scene. I do this to interfere with the viewers <b>perception</b> of the content of my images and to force them to start seeing them as photographs.
	<br> 
<br>
	I want my photos to make people consider how photos have come to be reflexively analysed for their content over their <b>physicality</b>. This is a  problem I think afflicts photography and stops it from being fully realised as an art form.
